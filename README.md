# VillagerUnknown's Inns & Innkeepers

Adds Inns and Innkeeper Villagers to world generation. Includes Hearthstone item to allow players to teleport to a bound Fireplace.

**Innkeeper Villager**

In addition to offering food and drinks, the Innkeeper sells a Hearthstone that allows players to teleport to a bound Fireplace. 

**Custom Blocks**
* **Fireplace** - The Fireplace, the Innkeeper's workstation, is always lit and allows players to set their Hearthstone's teleport location. 
The smoke from Fireplaces go through the blocks above allowing players to build functional chimneys! (Up to 16 blocks) 

**Custom Items**
* **Hearthstone** - The Hearthstone is a non-stackable item that can be bound to a Fireplace. 
When a Hearthstone is used by a player it will teleport the player back to the bound Fireplace.
